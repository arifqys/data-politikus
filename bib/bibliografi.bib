abstract = {Given a social network, which of its nodes are more central? This question has been asked many times in sociology, psychology and computer science, and a whole plethora of centrality measures (a.k.a. centrality indices, or rankings) were proposed to account for the importance of the nodes of a network. In this paper, we approach the problem of computing geometric centralities, such as closeness and harmonic centrality, on very large graphs, traditionally this task requires an all-pairs shortest-path computation in the exact case, or a number of breadth-first traversals for approximated computations, but these techniques yield very weak statistical guarantees on highly disconnected graphs. We rather assume that the graph is accessed in a semi-streaming fashion, that is, that adjacency lists are scanned almost sequentially, and that a very small amount of memory (in the order of a dozen bytes) per node is available in core memory. We leverage the newly discovered algorithms based on HyperLogLog counters, making it possible to approximate a number of geometric centralities at a very high speed and with high accuracy. While the application of similar algorithms for the approximation of closeness was attempted in the MapReduce framework, our exploitation of HyperLogLog counters reduces exponentially the memory footprint, paving the way for in-core processing of networks with a hundred billion nodes using 'just' 2TiB of RAM. Moreover, the computations we describe are inherently parallelizable, and scale linearly with the number of available cores. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Given a social network, which of its nodes are more central? This question has been asked many times in sociology, psychology, and computer science, and a whole plethora of centrality measures (a.k.a. centrality indices, or rankings) were proposed to account for the importance of the nodes of a network. In this study, we try to provide a mathematically sound survey of the most important classic centrality measures known from the literature and propose an axiomatic approach to establish whether they are actually doing what they have been designed to do. Our axioms suggest some simple, basic properties that a centrality measure should exhibit. Surprisingly, only a new simple measure based on distances, harmonic centrality, turns out to satisfy all axioms; essentially, harmonic centrality is a correction to Bavelas's classic closeness centrality [Bavelas 50] designed to take unreachable nodes into account in a natural way. As a sanity check, we examine in turn each measure under the lens of information retrieval, leveraging state-of-the-art knowledge in the discipline to measure the effectiveness of the various indices in locating web pages that are relevant to a query. Although there are some examples of such comparisons in the literature, here, for the first time, we also take into consideration centrality measures based on distances, such as closeness, in an information-retrieval setting. The results closely match the data we gathered using our axiomatic approach. Our results suggest that centrality measures based on distances, which in recent years have been neglected in information retrieval in favor of spectral centrality measures, do provide high-quality signals; moreover, harmonic centrality pops up as an excellent general-purpose centrality index for arbitrary directed graphs.},

abstract = {Prediction tasks over nodes and edges in networks require careful effort in engineering features used by learning algorithms. Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken together, our work represents a new way for efficiently learning state of-the-art task-independent representations in complex networks.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach to efficiently compute the exact closeness centrality values of all nodes in dynamically evolving directed and weighted networks. Closeness centrality is one of the most frequently used centrality measures in the field of social network analysis. It uses the total distance to all other nodes to determine node centrality. Previous work has addressed the problem of dynamically updating closeness centrality values for either undirected networks or only for the top-k nodes in terms of closeness centrality. Here, we propose a fast approach for exactly computing all closeness centrality values at each timestamp of directed and weighted evolving networks. Such networks are prevalent in many real-world situations. The main ingredients of our approach are a combination of work filtering methods and efficient incremental updates that avoid unnecessary recomputation. We tested the approach on several real-world datasets of dynamic small-world networks and found that we have mean speed-ups of about 33 times. In addition, the method is highly parallelizable.},

@article{Marchiori2000,
abstract = {The small-world phenomenon, popularly known as six degrees of separation, has been mathematically formalized by Watts and Strogatz in a study of the topological properties of a network. Small-world networks are defined in terms of two quantities: they have a high clustering coefficient C like regular lattices and a short characteristic path length L typical of random networks. Physical distances are of fundamental importance in applications to real cases; nevertheless, this basic ingredient is missing in the original formulation. Here, we introduce a new concept, the connectivity length D, that gives harmony to the whole theory. D can be evaluated on a global and on a local scale and plays in turn the role of L and 1/C. Moreover, it can be computed for any metrical network and not only for the topological cases. D has a precise meaning in terms of information propagation and describes in a unified way, both the structural and the dynamical aspects of a network: small-worlds are defined by a small global and local D, i.e., by a high efficiency in propagating information both on a local and global scale. The neural system of the nematode C. elegans, the collaboration graph of film actors, and the oldest US subway system, can now be studied also as metrical networks and are shown to be small-worlds.},

The metrics used to evaluate centrality for such networks include betweenness, closeness, degree, harmonic etc. The harmonic centrality is a better metric at leadership recognition. The authors propose an optimal machine learning approach to predict the harmonic centrality for each node based on few network parameters. The hypothesis that the distance from the source to destination contributes to the harmonic value is investigated. Regression models and Artificial Neural Networks were used to find the equation that fits the feature columns with minimum error. From the experiments, the authors concluded that the distance (closeness) does not contribute significantly towards leadership recognition in the network. Among the various approaches experimented with to predict the harmonic centrality, linear models showed a better fit and minimum error even in the case of scaling up the network.},

@article{VanDerMaaten2008,
abstract = {We present a new technique called "t-SNE" that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},
